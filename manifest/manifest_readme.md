# GECE-Reverse Manifest

These files were generated by scripts/generate_manifest.py by parsing:
- data/sheets/*.json for sheet schemas and flows
- data/vba/*.bas for modules, procedures, IO, and calls
- data/vba/forms/*.frm for forms, controls, and events

Update process:
1) Modify data sources, then re-run the script.
2) Validate references across data_map, logic_map, ui_map.
3) Commit regenerated files.
