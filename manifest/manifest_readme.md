# GECE-Reverse Manifest

This folder contains machine-readable maps to reverse-engineer GECE and reimplement it outside Excel.

## Files

- **data_map.json**: Sheet schema and dataflow. Includes fields, inputs/outputs, key formulas, and inter-sheet dependencies.
- **logic_map.json**: VBA logic inventory. Modules, subs/functions, I/O, sheets touched, and call graph.
- **ui_map.json**: Forms and UI controls. Events, macros, and sheet interactions.

## How to update

1. Export your Excel/VBA artifacts:
   - For sheets: Create JSON descriptors for each sheet in `data/sheets` with fields, formulas, inputs, outputs.
   - For VBA: Export modules (`.bas`) and forms (`.frm`) into `data/vba` and `data/vba/forms`.
2. Parse and merge:
   - Populate `data_map.json` with detected fields and data dependencies.
   - Populate `logic_map.json` by parsing `.bas` for subs/functions and calls.
   - Populate `ui_map.json` by parsing `.frm` for controls and event handlers.
3. Validate end-to-end:
   - Ensure every macro in `logic_map` references sheet elements present in `data_map`.
   - Ensure every UI control event references macros present in `logic_map`.

## Conventions

- Keep names consistent with Excel/VBA identifiers.
- Use `notes` arrays to capture gaps and assumptions.
